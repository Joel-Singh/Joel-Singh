### Howdy ðŸ¤ 

Hey, I'm Joel :), currently a student at Denison University with a full ride as a QuestBridge scholar.

My most significant experiences in programming has been web development projects through "The Odin Project" (an online curriculum,) my robotics team, and coursework.

I have experience (i.e done significant projects) in Java and Typescript. I have nominal experience in Python and C++ from my coursework and in Rust through games made with Bevy.
